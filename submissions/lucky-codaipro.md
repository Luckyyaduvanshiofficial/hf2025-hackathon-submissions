### 💡 Project Title
CodaiPro — Offline AI Coding Assistant

---

### 🧠 Project Description
CodaiPro is an **AI-powered coding assistant** designed for students, educators, and developers. It provides **offline code generation, debugging, and explanation** across 20+ programming languages — without any internet connection. Built with privacy, portability, and educational impact in mind, it runs locally on Windows systems and helps learners understand programming concepts through real-time AI assistance.

### 🚀 Inspiration behind the Project
As a student myself, I noticed that **most AI coding tools require internet access or paid subscriptions**, which makes them inaccessible in many computer labs and university exams.  
I created CodaiPro to make AI assistance **available offline, for free**, and fully focused on **learning and understanding code**, not just generating it.
